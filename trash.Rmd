First, let's get an idea of how quantity of trash varies by borough.

```{r total tons over time by borough - one graph across all time}
ggplot(merged_tons, aes(x=combined_ym, y = total_tons, color = borough, group = interaction(year, borough))) + 
    geom_line() + 
    labs(title = "Total Tons of Trash by Borough",
         x = "Date",
         y = "Total Tons",
         caption = "Data from DSNY Monthly Tonnage Data") 
```

Now, let's add in rat count to this graph.
```{r plotly rats by neighborhood}
merged_tons |>
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Number of Rats: ", ratcount, "\nTons of Trash: ", total_tons)) |> 
  plot_ly(
    y = ~ratcount, x = ~total_tons, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~borough, text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.5)
```

Lastly, we'll look to see if there is any relationship between type of waste and rat count.
```{r plot type of waste vs. rat count}
ggplot(merged, aes(x = ratcount, y = tons, color = type)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .6) +
  ylim(0, 85000) + 
  labs(title = "Tons of Trash by Rat Count and Trash Type",
       x = "Rat Count", 
       y = "Total Tons",
       color = "Type of Waste",
       caption = "Data from NYC Open Data and DSNY Monthly Tonnage Data")  
```
