# Tentative Project Title

"Do Rats Run This City?"

# Motivation

NYC appointed a Rat Czar in 2023 in response to increased complaints of rats over the last two years (Source: [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/04/13/1169851616/new-york-city-appointed-a-rat-czar-her-job-will-be-a-tall-ask)) - we would like to preliminarily analyze trends before and after the beginning of the Czarâ€™s reign 

# Intended Final Product

# Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding challenges 

1. Data analysis pre- and post- Rat Czar appointment to evaluate whether the Rat Czar appointment has yet proven to be effective 

2. Analysis of rat infestation volume over time 

3. Mapping trash v rat density 

4. Mapping density of poor restaurant inspection scores v rat density 

5. Look at changes during covid when lots of people fled the city 

6. Rodent-transmitted infectious disease prevalence by rat population numbers 

7. Correlation between number of rat sightings and rental price
