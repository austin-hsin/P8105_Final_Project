Welcome to our final project for Fall 2023's P8105 class! This project will take you through recent NYC data on rats and more- maybe you will learn something to avoid these furry foes.

## Welcome!
To make a long story short, we're interested in finding out if the rats really do run this city. Through our research, data tidying, analyses, and conclusions, we've tried to answer the question. Check out the rest of the website to see if you agree!
