Welcome to our final project for Fall 2023's P8105 class! This project will take you through recent NYC data on rats and more- maybe you will learn something to avoid these furry foes.

## Welcome!

Through our research, data tidying, analyses, and conclusions, we've tried to answer the question: Who rules NYC: the Rat King, or the Rat Czar?

## Motivation and Related Work
Rats are a common city problem, and recent estimates say that there are around [3 million rats](https://pix11.com/news/morning/city-rat-population-reaches-3-million-pest-control-company-claims/) in NYC alone. In fact, NYC is kind of iconic for its rats. As [NY Mag](https://nymag.com/news/features/rats-2011-11/) stated in 2011,<br>

<big><center>**"Humans and rats are inextricably linked by time and space."**
</big></center><br>


Of course, COVID-19 didn't help, as people were quarantined inside, allowing the [rat problem to grow](https://english.elpais.com/usa/2022-06-13/the-rat-scourge-tarnishing-new-yorks-image-and-post-covid-recovery.html).


<br>A viral soundbite even spread throughout the internet late last year:

<center><big>**"The rats are absolutely going to _hate_ this announcement. [But the rats don't run this city, we do.](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/19/1130026635/new-york-is-fighting-rats-in-the-streets)"**</big></center>

This was NYC Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch's statement before the announcement that starting in April 2023, New Yorkers would no longer be allowed to trash outside until after 8pm.

<br>And who can forget the hilarious public health campaign? <br>
<big><center>**["Send rats packing!"](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb2/downloads/pdf/notices/2023/SetoutTimes-Residential-Flyer-2023-02.pdf)**, </big></center>

they said, along with graphic illustrations of rats posted on trash cans around the city.

**In light of this, and in honor of the [Rat Czar](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/249-23/mayor-adams-anoints-kathleen-corradi-nyc-s-first-ever-rat-czar-) being crowned that same month, we sought to answer this age-old question: who runs this city? The rats, or the people?**
